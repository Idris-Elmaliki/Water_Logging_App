App Overview
============

I am currently developing with app with the ROOM library that logs the amount of water you drink.

Main Features
-------------

1. Be able to log in your water intake in real time.
2. Store user preferences, goals and daily progress.  
3. Pushing notifications to the user for reminders and motivation (with FireBase Cloud Messaging {FCM}).

All with the use of the **MVVM** architecture to ensure more sustainable code in mind!
